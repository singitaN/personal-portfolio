             <h2>Data Science</h2>
             <p>Data and analytics allow us to make informed decisions – and to stop guessing. I was never fond of making decisions based on gut feeling, perhaps because the gut says one thing one day, and something quite different the following day. The data ‘is what it is’ – even if it can also be easily abused. This is one lesson I learned when working with a group of intelligent peers at South Africa's Biggest Research Institution, CSIR and a <a href="http://dsideweb.github.io/about/" target="_blank">DSIDE</a> project they were hosting.

             <p>The link below will take you to a project I've worked on creating a tribute page to to the creator of google. <br>The thing that I love about being a web developer, and a developer in general, is and always has been the sole fact that it lets me create new things out of nothing.
