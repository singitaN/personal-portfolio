 <h1>BIO</h1>

<p>I am a Data scientist. I have always had an inquisitive mind and most of my curiosity was directed at computers. I loved going
out of my way to understand both the hardware functions of a computer, as well as the software that gave it purpose. I decided to study Information Technology and I discovered that I enjoy working with data and analyzing it with the use of python. <br>

<br>These learning experiences brought me to pursue a career in Data Science. I am eager to learn from the people around me, I catch on very quick with the latest technological innovations and I believe failure is a learning curve.<br>

<br>“I can not do everything, but I can do something. I must not fail to do the something that I can do.”
